{NOTE} The code can only run on Windows. To fix this you can change the 'cls' in system('cls') to the appropriate one for your operating system for example in linux it is 'clear'

  This is a project that I started as a means to build up to more complex projects. I enjoy breaking things down and figuring out how things work so rather than see this as a useless project, I prefer to think of it as a learning opportunity and I walked away with a little more knowledge.
  
  It only took 40 minutes to code, most of it was spent figuring out how to do some things like checking for winning moves and it runs without a hitch.
